# README for `run.py`

## Overview

The `run.py` file is the main entry point for starting the Classroom Monitoring System web application. It initializes the Flask app with Socket.IO support and runs the server using Eventlet for asynchronous networking.

## How It Works

- **Eventlet Monkey Patch:**  
  The script uses `eventlet.monkey_patch()` to enable cooperative multitasking, allowing the app to handle multiple simultaneous connections efficiently.

- **App Initialization:**  
  It imports and creates the Flask application instance using the `create_app` factory from the `app` package.

- **Socket.IO Integration:**  
  The app is run using `socketio.run()`, enabling real-time features (such as live room status updates) via WebSockets.

## Usage

To start the server, run:

```sh
python run.py
```

The server will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:5000/` by default.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-SocketIO
- Eventlet

Install dependencies with:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- The server runs in debug mode for development purposes.
- For production, set `debug=False` and consider using a production-ready WSGI server.

---

See `__init__.py` for the application factory and `routes.py` for route definitions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Classroom_Monitoring
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up the database:**
    - The default SQLite database is located in `classrooms.db`.
    - To initialize or migrate the database, use Flask-Migrate commands.

4. **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```
    The app will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
